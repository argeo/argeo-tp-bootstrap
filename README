Argeo TP Bootstrap is a build harness used to produce the third party libraries
required by Argeo Build.

In order to work around the chicken-and-eggs issues, the process is split
in the following phases:
- prepare the sources, removing the parts we won't be able to compile
- produce and intermediate build of the components
- produce a regular Argeo build of the components, using the intermediate build
output

## Plain build
$ ./configure
$ make prepare-sources
$ make

## Debian packaging
$ make prepare-sources
$ debuild -S
$ sudo pbuilder build ../argeo-tp-bootstrap_*.dsc
